  "content": "It is one of the most-watched sports in the world. It is a game of agility, endurance and teamwork. A full game of basketball is typically 40 minutes (4*10-min quarters) played between 2 teams, with 5 players on each side. Generally, there are 3 types of position: guard, forward and center and a basketball player would fall in one of these positions. It is common for players to stick to their positions throughout their career but in recent years, we have seen a rising trend of players transitioning to other positions as they advance in their careers. \n\n![](/images/uploads/basketball-positions.png)\n\n### **Guard**\n\nThe **point guard** is usually the shortest / smallest player on the team. They run the offense and are usually the best ball handler as well. They direct plays and connect their teammates with effective dribbles and passes. The point guard is also the last man of defence and is usually exceptional at stealing the ball from opponents. \n\n* *Famous players: Magic Johnson, Allen Iverson, Isaiah Thomas, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry, Russel Westbrook*\n\nThe **shooting guard** is the team’s best shooter. They are excellent 3-point shooters and typically run to free themselves for a clear shot. Generally, shooting guards have decent ball handling skills and are quick to run back for defense after a shot. Shooting guards have become more popular in the last 10 years. \n\n* *Famous players: Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, James Harden, Klay Thompson*\n\n### **Forward** \n\nThe **small forward** is the most versatile player on the court. They need to be all-rounded with the skills of both the shooting guard and power forward. Small forward has a strong body for defense but is also fast to make quick offensive plays. They have good shooting percentages and have the ability to drive towards the basket. At the same time, small forwards must keep an eye for rebounds as well. \n\n* *Famous players: Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen, Lebron James, Kevin Durant*\n\n**Power forward** has a similar role as a center. They are usually taller than their teammates as well and play a huge role in guarding rebounds for the team. However, power forwards could take longer shots than most centers with quicker leg movements. They have a tough physique for defense and are proficient mid-range shooters. \n\n* *Famous players: Karl Malone, Dennis Rodman, Anthony Davis, Kelvin Love, Blake Griffin*\n\n### **Center**\n\nThe **center** is usually the tallest player on the team. They play near the basket and are the protectors of rebound. Excellent centers make use of their height advantage to block opponents’ shots, secure both defensive and offensive rebounds and score easy under-basket and hook shots.\n\n* *Famous players: Bill Russel, Shaquille O’Neal, Marc Gasol, DeAndre Jordan*",
