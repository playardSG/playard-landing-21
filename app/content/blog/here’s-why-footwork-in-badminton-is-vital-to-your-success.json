  "content": "Badminton is a fun sport that keeps people on their feet. One of the factors players should keep track of is their footwork.\n\nCommonly deemed as underrated, footwork is one of the key factors that guarantees a win for badminton players. Footwork allows players to get to the shuttlecock in the shortest and fastest route. Not only does good footwork enables players to play with confidence and recover quickly, it also encourages variation.\n\n![](https://www.badmintonskills.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Badminton-Shoes-Racket.jpg)\n\nNow, how do we achieve a level of good footwork? Firstly, players should always return to the centre after hitting the shuttlecock. By being in the centre, you ensure you can arrive at all corners of the court in the same amount of time. This makes it harder for your opponent to find a weak spot. This technique is demonstrated by Terry Hee, who returns to the centre in his 2021 Southeast Asian Games matches - which ultimately won him a bronze medal.\n\n![](https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2022/01/16/mi_badminton_160122.jpg?VersionId=YAUQSYzymeFphbntm.AGyNhF3Ms0bl_4&h=7af99a00)\n\n\\\nSecondly, lower your centre of gravity. Doing so makes it easier to stop the inertia of going towards one direction and changing directions. Also, keeping your centre of gravity as low as possible stops your movement and going back to the centre becomes less demanding. To illustrate, former World no. 1 Lee Chong Wei always keeps his knees bent while moving on the court and this helps him to reach the shuttlecock more easily.\n\n![](https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2018/02/lee-chong-wei.jpg?impolicy=website&width=534&height=356)\n\nFinally, use your non-racket arm to balance your movements. When moving the racket arm around, the non-racket arm should be used to balance out your movement. Badminton professionals such as Grace Chua utilize this technique especially when she does a jump smash and underarm backhand clear.\n\n![](https://www.redsports.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SEA_Games_Badminton_13062015-439.jpg)\n\n\\\nIn conclusion, footwork is extremely important in badminton. By following these tips, players will definitely improve!",
