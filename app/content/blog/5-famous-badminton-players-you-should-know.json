In this article, we will talk about some of the most famous players in the world of badminton.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n**1. Lin Dan, 林丹 - China**\n\n![From InsideSport](/images/uploads/lin-dan.jpg)\n\nLin Dan (born 14 October 1983) is a Chinese former professional badminton player. He is widely regarded as a demon on the court. \n\nBy the age of 28, Lin had completed what most considered impossible, the \"Super Grand Slam\", having won the nine major titles in the badminton world: Olympic Games, World Championships, World Cup, Thomas Cup, Sudirman Cup, Super Series Masters Finals, All England Open, Asian Games, and Asian Championships. He became the first and only player to achieve this feat. \n\nHe also became the first men's singles player to retain the Olympic gold medal by winning in 2008 and defending his title in 2012.\n\n**2. Lee Chong Wei - Malaysia**\n\n![From Indiatoday](/images/uploads/lee-chong-wei.jpeg)\n\nDatuk Lee Chong Wei ( born 21 October 1982) is a former Malaysian badminton player. As a singles player, Lee was ranked first worldwide for 349 weeks, including a 199-week streak from 21 August 2008 to 14 June 2012. He is the only Malaysian shuttler who has held the number one ranking for more than a year.\n\nLee is a triple silver medalist at the Olympic Games, and the sixth Malaysian to win an Olympic medal. He won his first silver medal in 2008, also the first time a Malaysian had reached the finals in the men's singles event. This achievement earned him the title Datuk, and led to then Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak describing him as a national hero. He repeated the achievement twice more in 2012 and 2016, thus making him the most successful Malaysian Olympian in history.\n\n**3. Taufik Hidayat - Indonesia**\n\n![From BolaSports](/images/uploads/taufik-hidayat.jpg)\n\nTaufik Hidayat (born 10 August 1981) is a former Indonesian professional badminton player. He won the Olympic Gold medal in 2004 in Greece after winning the Gold medal in Asian Games in 2002, and became the badminton legend in Indonesia. \n\nFor much of the early 2000s, Hidayat dominated the international circuit. He was ranked the world No. 1 at just 19 years old. The young Hidayat led Indonesia to two Thomas Cup titles. He is well-known for his signature move, the incredibly powerful backhand smash.\n\n**4.
