  "content": "Unless you own a mansion with an underground indoor basketball court, finding a basketball court to play basketball is always a problem. Since most of us do not have that privilege, Playard decided to do some research on basketball courts in Singapore. Here are the top 5 ways to find a basketball court to play! \n\n<br/><br/>\n\n1. ### **Public outdoor basketball courts** \n\nThis is one of the reasons why I am greatly to be in Singapore. As a basketball myself, I play frequently at the public outdoor courts near my HDB! There are many outdoor basketball courts in Singapore, mostly situated in the residential areas. \n\n* Pros: It’s free! No booking needed\n* Cons: Can get crowded at nights from Wednesday to Saturday. Not an option if the sun is too hot or it’s raining. Best to avoid peak hours such as night time if you want to play in peace. \n\n![Outdoor Basketball Court](/images/uploads/outdoor-basketball-court.png \"From Street Directory\")\n\n2. ### **Public indoor courts in Sports Complexes**\n\nThis is a popular choice as sports complexes are conveniently located in close proximity to residential areas. Booking fee is fixed at $30 an hour for sports hubs and courts in school. Booking costs ~$23 an hour at CCAB sports hall (MOE Evans Stadium).\n\n* Pros: Easy booking on ActiveSG\n* Cons: Bookings run out almost instantaneously \n\n![OCBC Arena](/images/uploads/ocbc-arena.png \"OCBA Arena\")\n\n3. ### **Public basketball courts at Community Centres (indoor and outdoor)**\n\nMost basketball courts at CCs are indoor with some exceptions such as (Chong Pang CC and Siglap CC). You don't have to book the courts unless you want to ensure no one else is playing. To book a court in CCs, go on <https://www.onepa.sg/cat/facility>. \n\n* Pros: Booking is possible and rates are cheapest in Singapore at around $4-10 per hour\n* Cons: Booking process can be painful\n\n![Jurong Green CC](/images/uploads/jurong-green-cc.png \"Jurong Green CC\")\n\n4. ### **Private outdoor basketball courts in Condominiums** \n\nShocking to say, only a few condominiums in Singapore have basketball courts. With more than 3200+ condominiums, only less than 70 (~2%) have basketball courts on its premises. For those that have, most are outdoor basketball courts. \n\n* Pros: Booking is cheap at $10-20 / hr\n* Cons: Only open to residents   \n\n![Lakeshore Condo](/images/uploads/lakeshore-condo.png \"Lakeshore Condo\")\n\n5. ### **Private indoor courts**\n\nFor those who are willing to pay a premium for a private facility, there are some options in Singapore as well. For example, SG Basketball has 2 locations open for booking. The cost of booking is typically north of $100. \n\n* Pros: Have a private space to practise all sorts of crazy and embarrassing moves you have in mind \n* Cons: Extremely expensive and may not be feasible for most people in terms of budget    \n\n![Shot Zone](/images/uploads/shot-zone-bball-court.png \"Shot Zone\")\n\n## **Should you book a basketball court?** \n\nIn 2019, the number of basketball court bookings amounted to approximately 17.8K. That is almost 49 bookings a day in 2019! It is not uncommon for people in Singapore to book a court ahead of their basketball games. \n\n* If you have a group of friends up for 5v5, you could split the fees among the group with each person paying around $3-4 for a one hour game. Book a court would be ideal to avoid waiting long hours just to play. \n* Parents who wish to have regular training sessions for their kids may also prefer to book courts in advance. You could use Playard to find others to share the costs!\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n***P.S.*** *I actually did find a house with an indoor basketball court… leave a message in the comments section if you want a link to the article on that house.* \n\n![](/images/uploads/playard.jpg)",
